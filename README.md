## 📖 Project Overview

**ClayPOT** is an educational 2D game engine prototype developed in C++ to demonstrate the fundamentals of game engine architecture, advanced data structures, and software engineering principles. This project bridges the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and practical game development by implementing:

- **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture for flexible object management
- **Behaviour Trees** for intelligent NPC AI and decision-making
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm** for optimal path calculation and navigation
- **Grid-Based Tile System** for map management and collision detection
- **AABB Collision Detection** for efficient physics simulation

ClayPOT serves both as an **educational tool for learning engine development** and as a **functional game engine** capable of creating RPG-style games. It demonstrates real-world applications of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Design Patterns, and Software Engineering principles in a practical, game development context.

### Why ClayPOT?

Traditional game engines like Unreal and Unity abstract away the underlying complexity. **ClayPOT reveals the architecture**, allowing developers to:
- Understand how game engines work at a fundamental level
- Apply DSA concepts in real-world scenarios
- Learn professional C++ development practices
- Prototype and develop custom game mechanics

2. **Launch the engine**
   - Double-click `ClayPOT.exe`
   - If Windows shows a security warning: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - The engine window should open showing the main menu

3. **First-Time Setup**
   - The engine will automatically load all required resources
   - Ensure you have at least 100MB of free disk space
   - Verify all `.dll` files are in the same directory as the `.exe`

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClayPOT.git
   cd ClayPOT
   ```

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition works)
   - C++17 capable compiler

3. **Build the project**
   - Open `src_code/ClayPOT.sln` in Visual Studio
   - Set build configuration to `Release` for optimal performance
   - Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - Executable will be generated in the output folder
